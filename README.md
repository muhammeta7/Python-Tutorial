# Description
This repo is to document & create a tutorial to learn **Python**. Below is a list of useful links and definitions that may be of use. My focus is on the basics and branching out to work with data collection and analysis.

## <a id="what"></a>What is Python?
* Interpreted language that runs on *Windows* , *Mac OS X*, *Linux*, etc.
* Supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. 
* Supports basic data types such as strings and numbers and complex data types like lists and dictionaries.
* Strongly typed but is also dynamically typed, meaning you are freed from worrying about variable declarations.

## <a id="start"></a>Getting Started
*Personal preference but executable file download is the simplest option.   
Download and install Python based off your operating system and system type.
Choose and download the IDE of your choosing. I pay for `JetBrains ItelliJ` because I love it.*

#### Windows Download
* [Windows Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

#### Variables  
*When a program is running, everything the program needs is stored into the computer's memory.
In Python, a variable is a reserved location in memory to store values. In a program it gives data to the computer for processing.* 

[Variables Explained](https://realpython.com/python-variables/#object-references)

### Data Types 
  
#### Strings
 * Strings are a sequence of characters, and a derived data type.
 * Immutable: Once they are defined, they cannot be changed. 
 * Built-in Python methods such as `replace()`, `join()`,`split()`, etc.
