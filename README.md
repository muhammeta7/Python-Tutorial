# Description
This repo is to document & create a tutorial to learn **Python**. Below is a list of useful links and definitions that may be of use. My focus is on the basics and branching out to work with data collection and analysis.

## <a id="advice"></a> Personal Coding Advice & Experience
  #### Why Coding? 
   * Learn something new daily with a vast surplus of information & constant advancements in technology.
   * Career is in high demand AKA high salary. Rewards are priceless even without the high salary.
   * Flexibility to work remotely and save time on commutes.
   * Freedom to pursue personal projects and improve quality of life.
   * Community is enthusiastic to share wealth of knowledge with fellow developers.
   
  #### Keys to Success
  * Get ready to a master at Google. No need to memorize everything.   
  * Accept and embrace failure quickly. Avoid trying to be a perfectionist.
  * Troubleshooting and debugging mistakes thoroughly to find a solution is important for learning.
  * Type the code out until you feel comfortable enough to copy paste. Practice makes perfect.
  * You are essentially learning how to learn on the first go around.  
  * Be very specific in your questions and always research before asking.
  * Write easy to read code and use proper indentation.

## <a id="what"></a>What is Python?
  * Interpreted language that runs on *Windows* , *Mac OS X*, *Linux*, etc.
  * Supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. 
  * Supports basic data types such as strings and numbers and complex data types like lists and dictionaries.
  * Strongly typed but is also dynamically typed, meaning you are freed from worrying about variable declarations.

## <a id="start"></a>Getting Started
  *Personal preference but executable file download is the simplest option. Download and install Python based off your operating system and system type. Choose and download the IDE of your choosing. I pay for `JetBrains ItelliJ` because I love it.*

  #### WINDOWS DOWNLOAD
   * [Windows Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

  * #### VARIABLES  
  *When a program is running, everything the program needs is stored into the computer's memory. In Python, a variable is a reserved location in memory to store values. In a program it gives data to the computer for processing.*

  <details>
    <summary>Rules for Variable Names</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Must begin with a letter(upper or lower case) or an underscore_ character</li>
        <li>Can contain letters, numbers or underscore characters but can not begin with a number</li>
        <li>Variables are case sensitive so example and Example refer to 2 different variables</li>
        <li>Variables are names/labels that are bound to a value with the use of =.</li>

   * #### DATA TYPES
   *Strongly typed but is also dynamically typed, meaning you are freed from worrying about variable declarations.* 
    
   * <details>
       <summary>STRINGS</summary>
       <ul>
           <li>Strings are a sequence of characters, and a derived data type.</li>
           <li>Immutable: Once they are defined, they cannot be changed. </li>
           <li>Built-in Python methods such as `replace()`, `join()`,`split()`, etc.</li>
       </ul>
