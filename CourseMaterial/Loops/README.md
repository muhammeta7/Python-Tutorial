### For Loops
* Works by iterating over some set of values.
* Assigns each of the values one by one, to one or more variables.
* Executes block of code once for each value.
* Set of values comes from sequence or some other iterable object.

### Iterating over strings
```python
example = "abc 123 def"
for char in example:
    print(char)
```
Result
```
a
b
c

1
2
3

d
e
f
```

### Iterating over a range of values
* In Java and C for loops, you provide a starting value and an ending value, and increment a variable each time around the loop.
* Python's different approach to for loops makes them incredibly powerful and also very flexible.
* To get the same effect as C for loops, you can iterate over a **range** of values

```python

```
