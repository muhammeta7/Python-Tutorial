# Strings 
* Strings are a sequence of characters, and a derived data type.
* Immutable: Once they are defined, they cannot be changed.
* Built-in Python methods such as `replace()`, `join()`,`split()`, etc.

### Single, Double, and Triple Quotes
```python
single = 'I am a string'
double = "I am a string"
# triple quotes string can extend multiple lines
triple = """Hello, welcome to
           the world of Python"""
print(single)
print(double)
print(triple)
```
Results
```
I am a string
I am a string
Hello, welcome to
    the world of Python

```
